	 Everyone loves to see colorful flowers in bloom and along with helping in property value, a garden should be bountiful and
	 full of life.
	
	 This includes supporting the life around it as well. Houses with well-loved gardens tend to be sold for more profit 
	 than houses without it and are seen as more scenic and warm. 
	 
	 The garden may also contain flowers and plants that bloom at different times to maintain a beautiful color throughout the spring,
	 summer and fall seasons. 
	 
	 It also may encourage households with children to explore outside and spend more of their time outdoors with a gorgeous lawn to 
	 stay in. Those who want to host may find that guests would compliment them on their gardens for outdoor events like cookouts.
	 
	 The price for a garden is well worth the touch of life it will bring to anyone looking at your property. It is also very easy
	 to get started and can be done at any time during the year.
