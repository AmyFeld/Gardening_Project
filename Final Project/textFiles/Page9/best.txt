	The best places to go can vary by location. 
	
	A lot of people would suggest places like:
	
		- Gardener's Supply
		
		- Aerogarden
		
		- Seeds Now
		
		- Amazon
		
		- Overstock
		
		-  Burpee
		
		- Plow and Hearth
		
		- Plant Express
		
		
	and more, but it will take more than a list to be sure! Feel free to ask around from your neighbors, the internet, and visit
	different stores for different options, if you have time.
