While wanting to make your own garden can be exciting, it's important to know that even beautiful plants can act as a parasite and invade your garden.

For all new gardeners, DO NOT purchase these plants to include in your garden:
	- Chinese Wisteria: A vine introduced from China to the Americas over 2 centuries ago. It is knonw for
	  displacing native species and even large trees have been killed by Wisteria vines. 
	  
	- Bamboo: 
	
	- Winter Creeper:
	
	- English Ivy:
	
	- Winged Burning Bush:
	
	- Bradford Pear:
	
	- Princess Tree: 
	
	- Weeping Lovegrass: 
	
As beautiful as these plants may be and the aesthetic they may bring to your garden, it isn't worth
the aggressive growth and endangerment to all other flora surrounding it.
