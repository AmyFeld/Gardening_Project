What is the best way to start planting as a novice?
Research before buying a plant to see what the plant needs: see if the amount of sunlight and water is sufficient for the plant to survive, if the plant is compatible with the surrounding plants, and if there is enough space for it to grow healthily.
Invest in additional supplies such as fertilizer, hose, shovel

Why should I invest in owning more plants in my lawn?
Consider the cons of what is lost in a plantless lawn:
air quality decreases by the lack of trees which soak in water and carbon dioxide and release oxygen and nutrients for soil
bird species have declined by 3 billion in the last 50 years
water runoff increases which causes erosion and accumulation of pesticides in waterways (in sewers and even water reservoirs which we drink!)

How do I use pesticides safely?
Pesticides are useful to control pests, but can be dangerous if misused Some tips include finding any other alternative involving nonchemicals through destroying pest nests and breeding sites.
If using chemicals, read directions carefully, wear protective gear, and only use the recommended amount. Do not spray on rainy or windy days and ensure no one is present when spraying, such as animals, children. Always wait a couple of days/weeks to see if the pesticide is working before adding more. Read the instructions on how long to wait before harvesting a crop used by pesticides.
