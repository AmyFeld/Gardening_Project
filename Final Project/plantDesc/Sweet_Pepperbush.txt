Synopsis:
The Sweet Pepperbush are another plant well loved by honey bees. Its flowers can range between pink and white but our greenery only provides Sweet Pepperbush with white blooms. The flowers bloom strong and beautiful from mid to late summer, making them a fleeting scene. The water they need is high but animals such as bees, butterflies and even hummingbirds prefer to feed and hang around this plant. Handle this plant with care, however, as it does have spikes that might prick your fingers.
