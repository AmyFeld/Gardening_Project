Synopsis:
Lemongrass is an herb that tends to grow very tall and very fast. Although some species of lemongrass can sprout small
flowers, due to the northeastern climate, Lemongrass rarely if not ever blooms. Its common use is as an ornamental
grass that has a strong citrus flavor, hence its name. Another fragrant herb, this is most commonly planted in the
spring that grows rather quickly and needs very moist conditions due to its native home being very humid and hot.
Be wary however if you have curious outdoor pets as they may get sick if they decide to take a bite!
