Synopsis:
The Soft Caress Mahonia is a shrub that distinguishes itself from the rest for being such a late bloomer.
This plant is heavily resistant to the cold as even as the yellow flowers it blooms fade and the winter
starts coming in, it still is able to produce blue berries on its branches through parts of the early
winter. It doesn't require much work to grow but does need a moderate amount of water so make sure to give
it the hydration it needs.
