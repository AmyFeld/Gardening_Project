Synopsis:
The Scarlet Bottlebrush is a shrub that catches people's eye by its spiky flower shape. While many other plants in
our greenery sport very traditional flower shapes, the Scarlet Bottlebrush has scraggly and stiff red flowers that
maintain their red color throughout the spring and summer. The warmer it is, the happier this shrub will be! It
needs very little care as it survives well in poor soil and little water. This ia a statement plant ready to add
a dramatic flair to your garden's aesthetic. If you look a bit closely to the flowers as well, you might see the
yellowed tips they sport adn find yourself falling in love with them.
