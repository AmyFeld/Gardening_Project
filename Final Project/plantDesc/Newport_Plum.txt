Synopsis:
The Newport Plum is a tree that can bloom with either pink flowers or white flowers but our greenery only
offers Newport Plum with a pink bloom. This smaller tree is a great ornamental piece as it blooms early
in the spring season and has a purple hue to its leaves. You should make sure to take great care of this
tree as beauty comes with a price. The small fruit tends to feed native birds in the area and the flowers
themselves are fragrant when they bloom.
