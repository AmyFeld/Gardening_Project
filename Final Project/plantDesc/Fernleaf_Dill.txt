Synopsis:
The Fernleaf Dill is an herb that loves the cooler weather found in the fall. Its small yellow flowers begin to
peak out as teh weather turns colder but be wary, this plant does not withstand the cold well. Only needing a
moderate amount of water to grow properly, its uses as a culinary plant are its primary role. Known by some as
the "fish herb" for its wonderful complement to fish dishes, it cna be harvested during any time during the year
once the leaves have grown enough. For those who are more conscious about their sodium intake, this plant makes
a good substitute with its dried leaves.
