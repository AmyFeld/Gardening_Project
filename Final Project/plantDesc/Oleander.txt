Synopsis:
The Oleander is a shrub that is a beautiful but highly toxic plant. It has gorgeous blooms ranging from pinks to
reds but our greenery only offers Oleander with a pink bloom. As striking as this shrub is, the Oleander is fully
toxic from its branches to its roots to its flowers. Reaching its bloom time from spring to early fall, the most
common use of this plant is meant as a road blocker along highways as they don't need much maintainance but still
add some color. They are very heat resiliant as well. Just be careful with this one as it is poisonous to the point
of consumption may even lead to death.
