Synopsis:
The Western Sand Cherry is a Native American shrub that can be grown in most conditions. While it does prefer normal
conditions, it can easily make do with less water and poorer soil. It has quite decent ground coverage so it can
cover up any stray patches of grass. The fragrant flowers that bloom attract butterflies and the purple berries it
has helps feed birds all while being bee friendly! If you're someone who likes to bake, harvest the berries during the
summer and make some pies or jellies!
