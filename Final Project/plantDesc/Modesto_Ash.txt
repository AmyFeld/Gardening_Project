Synopsis:
The Modesto Ash is a majestic shade tree that is popularly used in the western parts of the USA. It is
very heat resistant and cold hardy, making it pretty low maintainance for watering as it is used to
having less water. This tree grows extremely quickly whch it means it'll make itself right at home in a
short amount of time. It casts plenty of shade for those who love the summer weather but the sun happens
to be too harsh. It also has a rough, textured bark which assists appearances when it loses its leaves!
