Synopsis:
The Vanhouttei Spirea is a shrub primarily planted for its shape and flowers. The showy nature of this plant is
demonstrated as its branches gracefully try to reach the ground with white bloom showing its path. The spring
bloom is notable due to the sheer amount the branches spread, making it seem like there are more flowers and thus
more bloom. While beautiful, this plant is a fragile beauty as it can be susceptable to diseases that often
affect teh rose family, such as powdery mildew and leaf spot. It needs a moderate amount of water to grow but
the Vanhouttei Spirea will offer excellent accents to your garden.
