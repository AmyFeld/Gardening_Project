Synopsis:
The Heritage Birch Tree is a tree that doesn't like to stand out in the garden. Its bloom and fruit
share the same color but both of them are inconspiciuous. This plant makes a wonderful barrier for
those who live near a wooded area and want to assist the forest around them. it blooms during the
transition from spring to summer but at least its canopy can keep you out of the harsh summer sun
and offer a little respite of shade in your yard.
