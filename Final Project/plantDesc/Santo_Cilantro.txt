Synopsis:
The Santo Cilantro is an herb that is a staple in a lot of Southwestern dishes. It is popular moreso for
its milder taste in both the plant itself and teh white flowers that it blooms. If you decide to let this
cilantro bloom, it is a popular nectar provider for bees and hoverflies. Primarily, it will have the
opportunity to bloom during the spring months due to the cooler weather. It also grows pretty quickly so
if in a pinch, look up a recipe and take some freshly grown Santo Cilantro for your next meal!
