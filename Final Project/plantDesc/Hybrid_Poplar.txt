Synopsis:
The Hybrid Poplar is a hybrid tree that a lot of wildlife tend to depend on for shelter and food. Deer,
rabbits, rodents and even porcupines tend to eat the twigs and leaves that the Hybrid Poplar produces.
Various sepcies of birds also tend to call this tree home but the Hybrid Poplar is more commonly used
for commercial use. Its bark is used for paper and firewood commonly and grows very rapidly. However,
it is very susceptable to disease so this tree, unfortunately, doesn't live very long.
