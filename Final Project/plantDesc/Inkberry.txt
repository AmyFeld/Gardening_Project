Synopsis:
The Inkberry is a dangerous and needy plant. Needing high amounts of water and varying levels of toxicity from person to person, it is more than just intimidating. Honey bees and brids flock to it for its berries during their fruition and bloom. Strangely enough, the Inkberry is a plant that needs both a male and a female plant to make berries so its important to keep the couple together to see their dark fruit.
