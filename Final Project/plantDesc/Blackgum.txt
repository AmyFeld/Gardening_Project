Synopsis:
The Blackgum is a tree with a special place for each and every honey bee. It can be a
main provier for thier pollen collection and honey production, making it a gentle giant
of trees. Growing from upwards of 100 feet, this tree needs quite a bit of water to survive.
The usual dark green leaves lighten and turn a golden yellow. It will begin to grow from
a straight trunk into a more twisted one, giving it an eery but mysterious atmosphere.
