Synopsis:
The Limelight Hydrangea is a shrub that is a little stronger than other hydrangeas. Unlike most other hydrangeas,
the Limelight Hydrangea is more resiliant to droughts and are a little less maintainance. The flowers are found
in clusters and all appear lime green during a majority of the blooming season of spring but as summer and fall
roll around, it takes center stage as its blooms transition from green to a range of colors, from pinks to purples
to blues. Your neighbors may be jealous when all they can see is the vibrant spot of color found in your garden!
