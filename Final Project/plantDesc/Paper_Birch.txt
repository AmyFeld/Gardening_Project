Synopsis:
The Paper Birch is a tree thta may have either yellow, green or brown bloom but our greenery only offers
Paper Birch with a yellow bloom. They need copious amounts of  water to thrive but their most distinct
feature is their white bark. The Paper Birch grows rather quickly, almost growing 2 feet per year. Deer
and moose like to eat away at their leaves when available and their fruit is a small, elongated shape.
In the fall, their leaves sport a golden yellow color and with the contrast of its white bark, it's a
wonderful addition to any fall set up!
