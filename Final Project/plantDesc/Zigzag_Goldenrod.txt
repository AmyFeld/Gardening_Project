Synopsis:
The Zigzag Goldenrod is similar to the original Goldenrod in that it requires medium amounts
of water and is primarily used for accenting gardens in the fall. Just like the regular
Goldenrod, the Zigzag Goldenrod has a later bloom from July to October to provide color when
most other plants had already finished blooming. Its nectar attracts bees and butterflies
during its bloom and its seeds provide bountiful food for sparrows and field mice if your
area has them as native fauna.
