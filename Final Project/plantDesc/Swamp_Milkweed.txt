Synopsis:
The Swamp Milkweed is anherb that blooms with both pink flowers and purple flowers but our greenery only offers Swamp Milkweed with pink bloom. Like the regular Milkweed and Butterfly Weed, the Swamp Milkweed also provides for the Monarch Butterfly caterpillars and attracts Hummingbirds. Their frgrance, interesting shape and edible sweet flowers hides toxicity as the Swamp Milkweed raw is quite toxic. Regardless, the high maintenance floer would make a wonderful and decorative edition to any garden!
