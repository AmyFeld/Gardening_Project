Synopsis:
The Sweet Fern is a shrub that comes to life during the mid spring to early summer season, where it becomes ripe
and ready fro harvest. The Sweet Fern gets its name from teh fragrance it emits naturally but even more so when
the plant is crushed. It grows quite slowly but it is a shorter plant in our greenery meant more for front lining
a garden or to line a pathway. It stays strong against any diseases that could harm it and can grow in poorer
conditions as well, making is one that you don't need to keep too much of an eye on.
