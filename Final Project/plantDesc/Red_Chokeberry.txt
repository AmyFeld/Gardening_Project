Synopsis:
The red Chokeberry is a showy shrub that grows in an avergae environment in terms of care. It produces small
red berries that appear glossy and ripen towards the late summer. The backdrop offered by its dark green
leaves makes the red from the plants truly pop and even those same leaves turn a bright crimson once the
summer fades into a cooling fall. If you would like to utilize the fruit, it can be made into jams and
jellies. It is a strong plant so it doesn't need much care in terms of protection from insects or disease
so make sure to give it love if it occupies your garden.
