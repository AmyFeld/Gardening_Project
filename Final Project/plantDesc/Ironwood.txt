Synopsis:
The Ironwood is noted as one of the sturdier trees which are commonly found in the
understory of forests. This tree grows to be quite tall so for those who have a
garden near a forest with no transition, adding these to your backyard will not only
benefit the look of your garden but also the ecosystem so close by. These hardwood
trees have attractive bark and wonderful colors during the Fall season. The best
feature about this tree is it's resistance to most pests and disease, so this tree is
made to last.
