Synopsis:
The Goldenrod gets its name from the striking yellow bloom it has. Unlike most
other plants, it blooms much later from late summer to throughout the fall. It
would fit in perfectly and stand out against the deeper oranges and reds of other
trees and shrubs. Giving it plenty of sun will ensure its beautiful bloom. It is
also quite resiliant to insects and possible diseses, making a strong edition to
any garden. Taking only a medium amount of water, the unique timing and beauty of
the Goldenrod is unbeatable.
