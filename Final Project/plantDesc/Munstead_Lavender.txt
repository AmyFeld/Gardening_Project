Synopsis:
The Munstead Lavender is very similar to its counterpart in our greenery, the Hidcote Lavender. It matches
all types of similarities from bloom time to color to uses due to them both being a type of English Lavender.
Another friendly plant for beginners, this herb is a resilient one that only needs a little water once fully
matured. It is recoommended to keep this plant in full sun and if you have a porch, you may want to plant it
around the parimeter to have guests experience the smell of homegrown lavender.
