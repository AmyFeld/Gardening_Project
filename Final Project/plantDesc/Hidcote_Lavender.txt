Synopsis:
The Hidcote Lavender of English Lavender is a highly fragrant and resiliant herb. It doesn't need much water once
grown to maturity and become the beginner gardener's favorite friend! It attracts bees and butterflies while keeping away larger animals from rabbits to deer. They make wonderful dried bouquet pieces for those who want to add a splash
of purple to any room and, due to the high essential oil content, will also leave a elegant lavender smell in the
area. It can last through the winter in terms of replanting but don't expect it to sport any of its usual colors.
