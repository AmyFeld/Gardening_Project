Synopsis:
The Peppermint plant is another hybrid herb between the spearmint plant and the watermint plant. Most know this flavor
from the countless labels from gums and toothpastes saying to taste like peppermint. It is an aromatic herb that gives
off a very minty smell. Peppermint prefers damp soil so make sure you continue to water it often! Peppermint can also
be harvested during its harvest season during the spring but its best to monitor this plant well as it may overgrow
quickly.
