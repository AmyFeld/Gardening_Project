Synopsis:
The Arp Rosemary is an herb that is known for being a low maintanance plant while also being quite resiliant. While, like
most plants, it can't survive northeastern winters, Arp Rosemary is resiliant in terms of needing less water and being
able to grow back quickly. It gives off a rosemary smell and its leaves can be harvested for culinary reasons, like bread.
During the mid spring to early summer, you may spot the small, light blue flowers that bloom on the rosemary's tall stems.
These flowers tend to attract pollenators and butterflies while warding off largers animals like deer and rabbits.
