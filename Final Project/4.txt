Overall Rating: 4 Stars

It's just shy of a perfect garden. You fully understand that a garden needs to incorporate
more than just aesthetics, as important as they are, just as not everything relies on being
too environmentally conscious. Your balance is almost just right, just fine tune it the
slightest bit from your lowest rating.
