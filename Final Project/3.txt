Overall Rating: 3 Stars

Your garden is certainly a good one. It has some colorful blooms, lasting longer than a simple
small grove next to a property but add different types of trees, take note of the needs of each
of your plants and try to give your garden maybe even longer bloom periods by having plants that
bloom at different months in the year. You've got the skills of a novice gardener, so keep
sharpening them!
