Overall Rating: 5 Stars

What an absolutely phenomenal garden! From colors to compatibility, your garden is top tier.
I'm sure your neighbors are envious of the blooms you'll have all year long and the animals
around your area will have a wonderful, blossoming ecosystem to visit. The variety of your
garden should be well appreciated and loved. Great job!
