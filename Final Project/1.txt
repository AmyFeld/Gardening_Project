Overall Rating: 1 Star

Your garden is struggling in quite a few areas. You seem to have selected plants that
overall aren't compatible with each other, have fully different needs in terms of water
usage, may bloom in only 1 or 2 colors and leave the edge much to be desired. Make sure
to broaden the kinds of plants in your garden with different blooms, types, and add plants
in that help the local fauna as well!
